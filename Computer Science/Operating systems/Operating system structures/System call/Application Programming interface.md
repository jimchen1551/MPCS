- aka **API**
- a set of funcitons available to an app programmer
- programmers access APIs via a library of code provided by the OS (libc for UNIX and Linux)
- providing better **portability** rather than [[System call]]
- easier to design for app programmers
- e.g., Windows API, POSIX API, and Java API
