# File-system management
## File
- a collection of related info defined by its creator
- representing programs and data
- normally organized into directories to make them easier to use
- OS abstracts from the **physical properties** (access speed, capacity, data-transfer rate, and access method) of its storage devices to define a **logical storage unit** (**file**). 
- OS maps files onto physical media and accesses these files via the storage devices. 
- OS responsible for
	1. Creating and deleting files
	2. Creating and deleting directories to organize files
	3. Supporting primitives for manipulating files and directories
	4. Mapping files onto mass storage
	5. Backing up files on stable storage media
