# Process scheduling
- maximizing [[Processor|CPU]] utilization
- selecting a [[process]] from [[Scheduling queue]] by [[CPU scheduling]]

- [[Context switch]]

- **Degree of [[multiprogramming]]**: the # of [[process]]es in [[memory]]
- **Swapping**: 
	- removing a [[process]] from [[memory]]
	- reducing the degree of multiprogramming
	- **swap out**: from [[memory]] to [[disk]]
	- **swap in**: from [[disk]] to [[memory]]

- **IO-bound process**: spending more of its time doing [[IO]]
- **CPU-bound process**: spending more of its time doing computation
