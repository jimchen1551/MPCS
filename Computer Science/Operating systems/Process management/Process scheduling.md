- maximizing [[Processor|CPU]] utilization
- selecting a [[process]] from the [[Scheduling queue]] by [[CPU scheduling]]

- **Degree of [[multiprogramming]]**: the # of [[process]]es in [[memory]]
- **IO-bound process**: spending more of its time doing [[IO]]
- **CPU-bound process**: spending more of its time doing computation
