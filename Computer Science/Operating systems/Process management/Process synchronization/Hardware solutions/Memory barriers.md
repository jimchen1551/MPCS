# Memory barriers
2 categories of memory model:
1. **Strongly ordered**, where a [[memory]] modification on one [[processor]] is immediately visible to all other [[processor]]s
2. **Weakly ordered**, where modifications to [[memory]] on one [[processor]] may not be immediately visible to other [[processor]]s
- computer architectures provide instructions that can **force** any changes in [[memory]] to be propagated to all other [[processor]]
