- An **abstract data type** (ADT) encapsulates data with a set of functions to operate on that data that are independent of any specific implementation of the ADT. 
- A **monitor type** is an ADT that includes a set of programmer-defined operations provided with mutual exclusion within the monitor. It also declares the variables whose values define the state of an instance of that type, along with the bodies of functions that operate on those variables.
