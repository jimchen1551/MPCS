# Preemptive scheduling
4 circumstances when making CPU-scheduling decisions:
1. When a [[process]] switches from **running** to **waiting**
2. When a [[process]] switches from **running** to **ready**
3. When a [[process]] switches from **waiting** to **ready**
4. When a [[process]] terminates
- for cases 1 and 4, it's **nonpreemptive** (cooperative)
