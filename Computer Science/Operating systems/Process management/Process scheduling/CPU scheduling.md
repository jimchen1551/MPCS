# CPU scheduling

| Fundamentals              | Explanation |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| [[CPU-IO burst cycle]]    |             |
| [[Preemptive scheduling]] |             |
| [[Dispatcher]]            |             |

| [[CPU schedular]]         | Explanation     |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| [[Short-term schedular]]  | ready → running |
| [[Medium-term schedular]] | ready → wait    |
| [[Long-term schedular]]   | new → ready     |
