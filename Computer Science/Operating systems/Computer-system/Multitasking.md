# Multitasking
- a logical extension of [[Multiprogramming]] for time sharing
- [[Processor|CPU]] switches processes so frequently that users can interact with each process while it is running, creating **interactive computing**. 
- **Response time** < 1 sec. 
- If several processes are ready to run at the same time, the system must choose which process will run next. $\Rightarrow$ [[CPU scheduling]]
- If processes don't fit in [[Memory]], **swapping** moves them in and out to run [[Virtual memory]] allows execution of processes not completely in [[Memory]].
