# File-system management
## File
- a collection of related info defined by its creator
- representing programs and data
- OS abstracts from the **physical properties** (access speed, capacity, data-transfer rate, and access method) of its storage devices to define a **logical storage unit** (**file**). 
- OS maps files onto physical media and accesses these files via the storage devices.
