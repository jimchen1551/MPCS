# Synchronous sequential circuit
![[Pasted image 20220703015547.png]]
- Its behavior can be defined from the knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time.
- Storage element: [[Flip-flop]]
## Clock sequential circuit
- using clock pulses in the inputs of storage elements
- having a master-clock generator to generate a periodic train of clock pulses
- seldom manifesting instability problems
