- At the level of primitives and functional blocks, libraries of **graphics symbols** are provided. 
## Logic simulators
- **verifying** the behavior and the timing of the hierarchical blocks and the entire circuits
## Logic Synthesizer
- **optimizing design** being generated automatically from HDL specs in physical area or delay
