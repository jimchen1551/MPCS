- It's similar to [[Read-only memory|ROM]]; however, because of the programmable AND matrix, not all of the [[Minterm]]s are represented. 
- While the # of [[Don't care conditions]] is more, [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] is much more economical than [[Read-only memory|ROM]]. 
- The whole process is supposed to be the sum of products.
