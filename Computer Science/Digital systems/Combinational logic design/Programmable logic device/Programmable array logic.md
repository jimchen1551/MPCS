- Unlike [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and [[Programmable logic array|PLA]], the fixed spec of [[Programmable array logic|PAL]] is not only the # of inputs and the # of outputs but the width of the AND-OR structure (the # of inputs of the [[Or]] gates). 
- less flexible than [[Read-only memory|ROM]] and [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] (but may be solved by passing the outputs of the other [[Or]] gates into the inputs of the unsolved [[Or]] gate, just like [[Multilevel optimization#Substitution]])
