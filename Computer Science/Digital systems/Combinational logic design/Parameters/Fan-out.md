# Fan-out
- the # of **standard loads** driven by a gate output
## Max fan-out
- the fan-out that the output can drive without impairing gate performance
## Transition time
- the time required for the output change from L to H and from H to L
- determined by fan-out for [[Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor|CMOS]] gate
