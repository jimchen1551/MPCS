# Propagation delay
![[Pasted image 20220617041607.png]]
- the **time required** for propagation from input to output
1. High-to-low propagation time  $t_{PHL}$
 2. Low-to-high propagation time  $t_{PLH}$
3. Propagation delay  $t_{pd}=max(t_{PHL}, t_{PLH})$
## Transport delay
- the change in an output in response to the change of an input
## Inertial delay
- similar to transport delay, except that if the input changes cause the output to change twice in an interval less than the rejection time, then the first of the two output changes does not occur
