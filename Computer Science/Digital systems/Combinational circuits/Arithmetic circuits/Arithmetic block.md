![[Screen Shot 2022-06-20 at 15.24.59.png]]
- designed to operate on binary **input vectors** and to produce binary **output vectors**
- able to be applied to each bit position
## Cell
- a subfunction block
- the overall implementation is an array of cellsâ†’[[#Iterative array]]
## Iterative array
- a kind of hierarchical circuits
- useful in handling vectors of bits
- The cells in the array are often, but not always, identical.
