# Open addressing
- All elements occupy the hash table itself. 
- Each table entry contains either an element of the dynamic set of NIL
- When searching for an element, examine table slots until the desired element is found, or not in the table. 
- Instead of following pointers, we compute the sequence of slots be examined. 

## Double hashing
## Linear probing
## Quadratic probing
