# Streaming SIMD Extensions
- Before SSE, [[x86]] implements FP arithmetic with the floating-point coprocessor of [[x86#8087]] (8 * 80-bit extended precision registers used as a push-down stack)
- Later, SSE was based on the FP architecture of [[x86#8087]]
- SSE2 added 4 * 128-bit registers and was used for multiple floating-point operands (SIMD)
