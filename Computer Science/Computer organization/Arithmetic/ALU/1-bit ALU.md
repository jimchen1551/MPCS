- AInvert and BInvert determine to execute any type of logic arithmetic while [[Multiplexer|MUX]] is at the [[And]] or [[Or]] mode. 
- BInvert determines to execute addition or subtraction while [[Multiplexer|MUX]] is at the add mode, like [[Binary adder-subtractor]]. 
- AInvert and BInvert decide to execute **set-on-less-than** while [[Multiplexer|MUX]] is at the [[Exclusive-OR|XOR]] mode.
