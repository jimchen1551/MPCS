# Structural hazard
- The **hardware** cannot support the combination of instructions that we want to execute in the same clock cycle. 
- conflicting for use of a resource
- **pipeline bubble** produced while stalling
- Solution: **duplication** of hardware (separate instruction and data memories)
- e.g., only one single memory in pipelining
