- nonvolatile semiconductor storage
- USB (universal serial bus)
- bits wearing out after more than 1000 of accesses
	- not suitable for direct RAM or disk replacement
	- wear leveling: remap data to less used blocks
### NOR flash
- bit cell like a NOR gate
- random read/write access
- used for instruction memory in embedded systems
### NAND flash
- bit cell like a NAND gate
- denser but block-at-a-time access
- cheaper per GB
- used for USB keys, media storage, ...
