# Dynamic linking
- only link/load library procedure when called
- requiring procedure code to be relocatable
- avoiding image bloat caused by [[Static linking]] of all referenced libraries
- automatically picking up new library versions
- reducing total resource (disk space, RAM, and cache space) consumption
