# Subword parallelism
- aka data-level parallelism, vector parallelism, or single instruction multiple data (**SIMD**)
- Graphics and audio applications can take advantage of performing simultaneous operations on short vectors. 
- e.g., 128-bit adder can be used to do 16 * 8-bit addtions, 8 * 16-bit additions, or 4 * 32-bit addtions.
