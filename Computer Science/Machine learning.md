# Machine learning
- an automatic process that extracts patterns from data (or past experiences)
- A computer program is said to learn from **experience** ***E*** with respect to some class of **tasks** ***T*** and **performance** measure ***P***, if its performance at tasks in *T*, as measured by  *P*, improves with *E*.
