# Divide-and-conquer approach
- If the problem small enough, $\Rightarrow$**base case**.
- Else, $\Rightarrow$**recursive case**.
- **Divide** the problem into a number of subproblems. 
- **Conquer** the subproblems by solving them recursively. 
- **Combine** the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem. 
- e.g., [[Merge sort]], [[Strassen's algorithm]]
## Recurrence
1. Substitution method
2. Recursion-tree method
3. Master method
