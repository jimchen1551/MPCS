# Substitution method
1. Guess the form of the solution using a symbolic constant. 
2. Use mathematical induction to show that solution works and find the constant. 
## Subtleties
- used while failing in the induction proof
## Avoiding pitfalls
- avoid using [[Asymptotic notation]] in the inductive hypothesis because of the constants hidden by [[Asymptotic notation]]
## Changing variables
