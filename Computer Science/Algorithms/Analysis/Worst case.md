# Worst case
$$\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max\ }
T_{wc}(n)\equiv\argmax_t t(s_i),\forall s_i\in S$$
- Define a class of input instances for which an algorithm exhibits its worst runtime behavior. 
- The worst-case running time is an **upper bound** on the running time for any input. 
- For some algorithms, the worst case occurs fairly often. (e.g., searching a database for absent info)
