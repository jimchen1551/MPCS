# Information-based learning
[[Information theory]]
## Decision trees
![[Screen Shot 2022-10-31 at 18.28.17.png]]
- consisting of a root node (or starting node), interior nodes, and leaf nodes (or terminating nodes) that are connected by branches
- Each non-leaf node in the tree specifies a test to be carried out on a descriptive feature. 
- The number of possible levels that a descriptive feature can take determines the number of downward branches from a non-leaf node. 
- Each of the leaf nodes specifies a predicted level of the target feature. 
## Shannon's entropy model

## Information gain

## ID3 algorithm

## Alternative feature selection

## Impurity metrics

## Tree pruning

## Model ensembles
