# Information-based learning
[[Decision tree]]
## Shannon's entropy model
$$H(X)=-\sum_iP(x_i)\lg P(x_i)$$
- measuring the uncertainty of a probability distribution (
- the higher $Pr$ the lower $Entropy$
- If we have $M$ uniform outcomes in total, we need $\lceil\lg M\rceil$ bits ($\lceil\lg Pr\rceil$, also can be seen as the number of uncertainty) at least. 
## Information gain

## ID3 algorithm

## Alternative feature selection

## Impurity metrics

## Tree pruning

## Model ensembles
