# Information-based learning
[[Decision tree]]
[[Shannon's entropy model]]
## Shannon's entropy model
$$H(X)=-\sum_iP(x_i)\lg P(x_i)$$
- measuring the uncertainty of a probability distribution (or the impurity, heterogeneity of a set)
- The higher $Probability$ an outcome have, the lower $Entropy$ it implies. 
- If we have $M$ uniform outcomes in total, we need $\lceil\lg M\rceil$ bits ($\lceil\lg Pr\rceil$, also can be seen as the number of uncertainty) at least to encode each outcome. 
## Information gain

## ID3 algorithm

## Alternative feature selection

## Impurity metrics

## Tree pruning

## Model ensembles
