# Error function
- to formally measure the fit of a model with a set of training data
- capturing the error b/w the predictions and the ground truth
## Sum of squared errors
$$L_2(\mathbf{M}_w, D)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n(t_i-\mathbf{M}_w(d_i))^2$$
- aka SSE, MSE and $L_2$
- often used for [[Linear regression]]
