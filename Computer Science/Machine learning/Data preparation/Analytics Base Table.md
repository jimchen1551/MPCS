# Analytics Base Table
- the basic structure in which we capture the historical datasets
- the columns are divided into **a set of descriptive features** (inputs) and **a single target feature** (outcome)
- each row contains a value for each descriptive feature and the target feature and represents an **instance** about which a prediction can be made
