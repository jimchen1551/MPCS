# Feature selection
- the number of descriptive features in a dataset increases â†’ the predictive power of an induced model decreases
- The **predictive power** of an induced model is based on
  1. Partitioning the [[Feature space]] into regions based on clusters of training instances with the same target value, and assigning a query located in a region the target value of the cluster that defines that region
  2. Assigning a query a target value interpolated from the target values of individual training instances that are near the query in the feature space

## Curse of dimensionality
If the feature set size is pretty large, there may exist 
1. redundant features
2. irrelevant features
3. informative derived features (e.g., $g_k=f_i\otimes f_j$)
