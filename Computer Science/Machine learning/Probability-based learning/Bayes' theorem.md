# Bayes' theorem
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$
$$\displaystyle P(A_i|B)=\frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\Sigma_{j=1}^nP(B|A_j)P(A_j)}=\eta\cdot P(B|A_i)\cdot P(A_i)$$
$$\eta=\frac{1}{P(B)}=\frac{1}{\Sigma_{j=1}^nP(B|A_j)P(A_j)}$$
- the probability that an event has happened given a set of evidence for it is equal to the probability of the evidence being caused by the event multiplied by the probability of the event itself
