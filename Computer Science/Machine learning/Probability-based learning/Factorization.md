# Factorization
$$P(H, F, V, M)=P(M)\times P(H|M)\times P(F|M)\times P(V|M)$$
- simplifying the full [[Joint probability distribution]] if conditional independence
- rather than calculating and storing the probabilities of all the joint events in a domain, we break up the distribution into **factors** (defining distributions over subsets of features)
